# Gefestfilms
This is an online cinema.

This is a full-fledged CRUD application written in Spring MVC.
I use JDBC template to work with the database (I write SQL queries in the code).
The project uses a PostgreSQL database.
This application is configured with Java code and uses annotations.
Thymeleaf template engine is used to connect Java code to HTML.
The fields of the Film class have form validation that prevents
incorrect values from being passed to the database.
